# EVM Wallet manual

The [EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet)
manuals.

## Installation

The manuals in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The program has officially been published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-wallet`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-wallet
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evm-wallet-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet-ur).
Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.

A package has also been released on NPM as `evm-wallet.js` and
can be installed with

```bash
npm \
  install \
    evm-wallet.js
```
